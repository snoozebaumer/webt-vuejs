# webt-vuejs
mock "web shop" I made for WEBT finals at HSLU (semester 1/6), time spent ~12h
<p>The most interesting part of this project would probably be the dynamic forms and form validation, the rest was basically just fulfilling the requirements.</p>
The php part of this project doesn't make much sense, however that's what the requirements told us to do.
